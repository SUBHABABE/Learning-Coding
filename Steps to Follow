To be honest with you, things weren't always easy. The exact instructions on how to learn front-end the right way were often annoying during my lengthy and challenging seek to become proficient in the language.  A lot of courses out there overcomplicate the process of learning Python. 

To make my point, allow me to share a personal instance with you. I wanted to accomplish the things that fascinated me when I first started studying Python, like creating websites or using artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, I had to spend months studying tedious syntax for the courses I was taking. It was horrific!  

I tried a lot of different methods,  But I was willing to give up sleep in order to finish interesting projects based on Python concepts. Anyone can learn and become proficient in Python programming if they have enough motivation. For me as newbie, grappling with syntax was difficult at first.
