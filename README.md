# HTML Project Tutorial - Event Page, Tables, and Forms

Welcome to the HTML Project Tutorial repository! This repository contains the starter and final code for two complete projects that will be covered in a YouTube tutorial series. The tutorial series aims to provide comprehensive knowledge about HTML and guide you through building two exciting projects: an Event Page and a project focused on Tables and Forms.

## Project 1: Event Page
You can find the project files in the [Project 1: Event Page](HTML%20Tutorial/Web%20Page%20HTML%20Project/) folder.
In the first project, we will build an Event Page that will cover a wide range of fundamental HTML components. 

Throughout this project, you will learn how to use the following HTML elements:
- Heading Tags: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`
- Paragraph Tags: `<p>`
- Anchor Tags: `<a>`
- Body Tag: `<body>`
- HTML Boilerplate: `<html>`
- Image Tag: `<img>`

By the end of this project, you will have a clear understanding of how to structure basic HTML elements and create an appealing Event Page.

## Project 2: Tables and Forms
You can find the project files in the [Project 2: Tables and Forms (Event Management HTML Project)](HTML%20Tutorial/Event%20Management%20HTML%20Project) folder.

In the second project, we will dive deeper into HTML by focusing on two important components: Tables and Forms. Tables are used to present data in a structured format, while forms are essential for user input and data submission. Throughout this project, you will learn to use the following HTML elements:

- Table Tag: `<table>`
- Table Row Tag: `<tr>`
- Table Header Cell Tag: `<th>`
- Table Data Cell Tag: `<td>`
- Form Tag: `<form>`
- Input Tags: `<input>` (various types), `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `<option>`, `<label>`, `<button>`

By the end of this project, you will be proficient in creating tables and forms, and you'll understand how to collect user input and process it.
